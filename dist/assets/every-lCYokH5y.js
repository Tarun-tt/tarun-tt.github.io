var e={id:`every`,title:`Every`,definition:`Every is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that every developer should master.`,deepExplanation:`Understanding every deeply helps you write cleaner, more maintainable code. It connects to how modern applications are built, debugged, and scaled. You'll learn why it exists, when to use it, and how professionals apply it in production systems.`,syntax:`// Every syntax
